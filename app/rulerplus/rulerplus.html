					<blockquote>Universal design describes a set of considerations made to ensure that a product, service, and/or environment is usable by everyone, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. Accessibility is only slightly different, describing the degree to which a product, service, and/or environment is made available to everyone.  <br><cite>-- Andrew Maier, The Complete Beginner’s Guide to Universal Design</cite></blockquote>

					<p>Ruler Plus was a project that I designed for Interface Design Class at Columbia College Chicago. </p>
					<p>Ruler Plus is a free measurement app with augmented reality and 3D. It helps consumers with room planning for interior design and measures the size of particular objects such as suitcases, cars, and buildings. With Ruler Plus consumers can easily measure and create 3D models of everything in your home, from sofas to glass cabinets or other furniture and place them virtually anywhere using the unique augmented reality and 3D modeling techniques.</p>
					<p>Ruler Plus is also able to solve other measurement problems in our lives. For example, measuring a space to see if it can be fit a couch, measuring the height of a historical building to educate ourselves or others, and measuring the length of a bed to see if it can be fit in my SUV.</p>
					<p>There are a lot of times in our lives that we need to figure out a measurement, but we don’t always have a ruler in our hand; however, nowadays, we almost all have a smartphone in our pocket, so when measurement becomes digital from physical, our lives can be easier. </p>
					<p>This prototype is made easy to use for either professionals and basic users. When the user opens the app, he/she gets to choose the functionality model between professionals and basics. The range of the functionality covers almost every user who has a smart phone. The interface is clean and straightforward. Snap, drag, save, and share. There you go! A handy digital ruler that you always carry with. </p><br>
